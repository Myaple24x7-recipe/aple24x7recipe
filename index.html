<h2>Apple Halwa Recipe</h2>
<p>1. Rinse 1 kilogram of apples (7 to 8 medium-sized apples) very well in water using a colander. Drain all the water. Then peel each apple.

I suggest using sweet-tasting apples. This way you will have to add less sugar. Here I have used the Indian variety of Kinnaur apples. You can use any good variety of ripe, fresh, crisp and sweet-tasting apples.</p>
   <br>
   <p>2. Using a knife, quarter them and slice off the part containing seeds and pith.</p>
   <br>
   <p>3. Then chop the apples into small cubes. You will need 7 cups of chopped apples.</p>
   <br>
   <p>4. Heat a heavy kadai (wok), skillet or frying pan and keep heat to medium-low. Add 2 tablespoons ghee to the kadai and let it melt.</p>
   <br>
   <p>5. Add the chopped apples.</p>
   <br>
   <p>6. Mix it with the ghee and begin to saute the apples on low to medium-low heat.</p>
   <br>
   <p>7. Saute for about 5 to 6 minutes stirring often. You will see that some cubes of apples will soften and some won’t by this time of cooking.</p>
   <br>
   <p>8. On a low to medium-low heat cook covered with the lid till all the apples have softened and become mushy. The apple mixture will start to thicken.

When the apples have softened then with a spoon or a potato masher, mash the cooked apples and keep on stirring so that the mixture does not stick to the bottom of the pan. You could keep some small chunk-sized pieces or cubes of apples if you want.</p>
   <br>
   <p>Then add 5 tablespoons of sugar. In case if your apples are slightly tangy then you will require to add some more sugar. So the amount of sugar to be added depends upon the sweetness of the apples and also on your taste preference.

You can use raw sugar or white sugar. Here I have added unrefined sugar. You can also add jaggery, brown sugar, coconut sugar, palm sugar or maple syrup.</p>
   <h3>Apple Benifits</h3>
<h3>1. Supports hydration<h3>
<p>Apple juice is 88% water and tastes good. This makes it easy to consume — especially for those who are sick and at an increased risk of dehydration.

In fact, some pediatricians recommend half-strength apple juice — a mix of half juice, half water — for sick kids who are mildly dehydrated and at least one year old.

In a study of mildly dehydrated children with diarrhea and vomiting, those offered diluted apple juice were 6.5% less likely to need fluids delivered via their veins than those given a medicinal electrolyte drink</p>
<h3>2. Contains beneficial plant compounds</h3>
<p>Apples are rich in plant compounds, particularly polyphenols. While the majority of these compounds are in the peel, some from the apple flesh are retained in the juice.

These plant compounds may protect your cells from inflammation and oxidative damage. Both of these processes are underlying factors in chronic conditions, including certain cancers and heart disease.

In one study, healthy men drank a 2/3 cup (160 ml) of apple juice, then scientists drew their blood. Oxidative damage in their blood was suppressed within 30 minutes of drinking the juice, and this effect continued for up to 90 minutes (9Trusted Source).

For more polyphenols, opt for cloudy juice — which contains pulp — rather than clear, which has the pulp removed.

One analysis found that cloudy apple juice had up to 62% more polyphenols than clear juice.

The majority of store-bought apple juice is clear in appearance, meaning you can easily see through it. Organic varieties are more commonly available in the cloudy form.</p>
